GLSL Blur Collection for GEM
version 0.0.1

This is a collection of blur shaders revisited and ported to Pure Data by Guido from a set of Quartz Composer effects by Anton Marini.

As you will see in the "fastBlur.pd" patch this collection has to be considered only as an experimental release useful for study purpose and further development. Even if it works quite smoothly there are some stuff to be fixed, use these patches in your project at your own risk :)

Tested on Pd 0.42.5 with Gem 0.92.3
MacOSX 10.5.8 nVidia GeForce 9400M
